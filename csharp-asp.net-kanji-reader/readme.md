# 📂 Data Directory

This folder contains local dictionary and cache data files used by the Kanji Reader web application.

## 📘 JMdict Dictionary File

This project uses the official **JMdict_e.xml** file provided by the [Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group (EDRDG)](https://www.edrdg.org/).

### ❗️Important:
The JMdict file is **not included in this repository** due to its large size and licensing considerations.

---

## 🔽 How to Obtain JMdict_e.xml

1. Visit the official JMdict download page:  
   🔗 https://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/edict_doc.html

2. Look for a section titled **“Download”**, then download the file:  
   **`JMdict_e.gz`**

3. Extract it to get the uncompressed XML file:  
   **`JMdict_e.xml`**

4. Place the extracted file in this directory:  

	csharp-asp.net-kanji-reader/Data/JMdict_e.xml



---

## 📦 Optional: JSON Cache

This folder may also contain a `JMdictCache.json` file generated by the app to reduce startup time.

If it's not present, the app will build it on first load (from `JMdict_e.xml`).
